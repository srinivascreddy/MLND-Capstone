## TMDB Movie Revenue Prediction 

### Project Overview
We live in a movie obsessed world, where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, if we include home entertainment revenue global film industry is worth $136 billion. The film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? For some movies, it's "You had me at 'Hello.'" For others, the trailer falls short of expectations and you think "What we have here is a failure to communicate." 

*Objective*
Objective of this project is to predict a movie revenue based on historic data about movie revenues and performance at the global box office. Such a prediction would be useful for optimization in many areas during various stages of planning and production of movies, for instance, selection of actors, crew, location, production spend, marketing spend, logistics and so on.
